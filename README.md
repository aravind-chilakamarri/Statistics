# Statistics Refresh for Data Analytics and Machine Learning

Welcome to my statistics refresher repository! I'm on a journey to re-learn statistics for data analytics and machine learning, drawing insights from various sources including YouTube tutorials and books like ["Practical Statistics for Data Scientists"](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962/ref=sr_1_4?crid=8O51IX8FMADS&keywords=Practical+Statistics+for+Data+Scientists&qid=1698963233&sprefix=practical+statistics+for+data+scientists%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-4). I'm excited to share my notes and you can contribute your own insights, comments, and lessons.

## Why Refresh Statistics for Data Analytics and Machine Learning?

A strong foundation in statistics is essential for making informed decisions in data-driven fields like data analytics and machine learning. By revisiting and deepening my understanding, I aim to enhance my ability to extract meaningful insights from data.
